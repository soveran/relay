RELAY(1)

NAME
      relay -- Relay commands over SSH.

SYNOPSIS
      relay [-c command] [-f recipe] server1 [server2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
      Relay is a simple library that allows you to send commands over SSH. It uses
      your own SSH, not a Ruby version, so you can profit from your settings and
      public/private keys.

      The following options are available:

      -c command
          Executes the command on the passed servers.

      -f recipe
          Reads commands from a file and executes them in the passed servers.

USAGE
      To send a command to two servers called `server1` and `server2`:

          $ relay -c "ls -al" server1 server2
          $ relay -c "cd foo; ls" server1 server2
          $ relay -c "cd foo" -c "ls" server1 server2

      If you want to send more commands, you can write a shell script:

          $ cat recipe.sh
            cd foo
            ls
            mkdir -p bar/baz

          $ relay -f recipe.sh server1 server2

      It will execute those commands on both servers and show the output.


      You can use each flag many times, so this is possible:

          $ relay -f recipe1.sh -f recipe2.sh server1 server2 server3
